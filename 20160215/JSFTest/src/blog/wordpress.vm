This page will demonstrate the difference between a @RequestScope and @ViewScoped managed bean in a AJAX enabled JSF application. 

<h3>Background</h3>

The @RequestScoped bean lives as long as a single HTTP request-response cycle. This includes AJAX request and responses. At the end of the cycle the bean will be no longer available.

The @ViewScoped managed bean lives as long as you are on the same view like action calls with post-backs that don't result in the page changing. This includes actions that result in output being sent to another component on the page. 

To demonstrate the difference between @ViewScoped and @RequestScoped we will define 2 managed beans each with a different Scope and use them within a AJAX enabled JSF page. We will use the Java EE @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations to print out when each bean is created and destroyed.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Java 8 or above</li>
<li>Maven 3 or above</li>
<li>Tomcat 7</li>
</ul>


<h3>Create the pom.xml</h3>
vi pom.xml
[code language="xml" light='true']
#include("pom.xml")
[/code]

The following is the Request Scoped Managed bean. 

vi src/main/java/com/test/AddressBeanRequestScoped.java
[code light="true"]
#include("src/main/java/com/test/AddressBeanRequestScoped.java")
[/code]

The following is the View Scoped Managed bean.

vi src/main/java/com/test/AddressBeanViewScoped.java
[code light="true"]
#include("src/main/java/com/test/AddressBeanViewScoped.java")
[/code]

The following AJAX enabled JSF page uses both beans. 
vi src/main/webapp/ajaxExample.xhtml
[code language='xml' light="true"]
#include("src/main/webapp/ajaxExample.xhtml")
[/code]

And finally the web.xml file.

vi src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
[code language='xml' light="true"]
#include("src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml")
[/code]

Start tomcat 7 and navigate to the following page: 
http://localhost:8080/JSFTest/ajaxExample.xhtml

You should be able to view the difference on the eclipse console or Tomcat 7 console log while you type within the text boxes on the JSF page.
